Crime has been a prevalent anti-social trait in the human society since time immemorial and it continues to be so even today. Analysing many aspects of crime and identifying criminal trends are highly important. Therefore, having a criminal information system that can analyse a lot of data quickly is essential. Also, one of the most efficient techniques to explore, analyse, find patterns, and forecast future crimes in a vast quantity of data is data analysis by using classification. Therefore, we aimed to work on a dataset that can help us build our model.
